Phishing – Student Notes Summary

Phishing is a scam where attackers trick people into revealing personal info, passwords, or money. These messages look real, so victims trust them. It’s one of the most common attack methods because it targets people, not computers.

Common phishing tactics:
• Urgency or fear (e.g., “Immediate action required”).
• Look-alike email domains (small changes like rnicrosoft.com).
• Fake display names (name looks familiar, email doesn't match).
• Malicious attachments asking to enable macros.
• Messages sent from hacked real accounts.
• Offers that seem too good to be true (prizes, refunds, jobs).
